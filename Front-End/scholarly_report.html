    <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> In our overview of mouse racing, we try to understand how a race works and how
        this industry has changed over time.
        To do this, we need a clear and consistent definition of what mouse racing is and how it is different from any
        other form of racing.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> Rats races are seen as races in which mice have to run aimlessly just to get a
        piece of cheese or a reward, but from them, some people can get rich overnight.
        It all consists of the chosen mouse and the way it runs.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> The key issue is that this type of betting is difficult to distinguish from
        other forms of betting, such as football betting, tennis betting, basketball betting.
        The lines between these different forms of betting are often blurred, as people only see the opportunity for
        enrichment, but not the fact that mice are kept hungry in order to run after cheese.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> Here, we have created a portal where each player can bet on any mouse he wants
        and can see how he did in the last matches to see what the chances of winning are.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> The following sections outline the application requirements, features, how our
        users interact with it, and the responsibilities of each team member.
