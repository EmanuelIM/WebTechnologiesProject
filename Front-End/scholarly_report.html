    <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> In our overview of mouse racing, we try to understand how a race works and how
        this industry has changed over time.
        To do this, we need a clear and consistent definition of what mouse racing is and how it is different from any
        other form of racing.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> Rats races are seen as races in which mice have to run aimlessly just to get a
        piece of cheese or a reward, but from them, some people can get rich overnight.
        It all consists of the chosen mouse and the way it runs.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> The key issue is that this type of betting is difficult to distinguish from
        other forms of betting, such as football betting, tennis betting, basketball betting.
        The lines between these different forms of betting are often blurred, as people only see the opportunity for
        enrichment, but not the fact that mice are kept hungry in order to run after cheese.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> Here, we have created a portal where each player can bet on any mouse he wants
        and can see how he did in the last matches to see what the chances of winning are.
      </span><br>
      <span style="padding-left: 2rem;"> The following sections outline the application requirements, features, how our
        users interact with it, and the responsibilities of each team member.

    <h2><span>3. </span>Project Description</h2>
    <p>

      <h3><span>3.1 </span>Features</h3>
      <br> The main features of the application are:
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication: Allows the users to sign up and sign in to use the website</li>
        <li>Making a bet: Allows a user with an account to place a bet on certain races</li>
        <li>
          Modifying the profile: The user can change their username, avatar, email and any other info
        </li>
        <li>Seeing a bet history: Users can see a history of their bets and they can check if the bets were successful
          or not. They can also download their bet history in HTML/CSV/JSON formats.</li>
        <li>Checking a rat profile: Users can see the status of a rat's last five races, as well as information about
          that rat.</li>
        <li>Adding a match : Admins can add matches for normal users to view and bet on.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="userint">
      <h3><span>3.2 </span>User Interactions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>When the user first enters the site, they will be redirected on the Landing Page.</li>
        <li>After that, the user can choose between the Login option (if they already have an account) or the
          SignUp option (if they want to register). According to their choice, they will be taken on the specific page.
        </li>
        <li>Once they are logged in, they will be on the Dashboard Page, where they will have a Menu
          with different option:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Dashboard</li>
          <li>User Profile Settings</li>
          <li>Your Bets</li>
          <li>Add Money</li>
          <li>Add a match (Admin only)</li>
          <li>Add a rat (Admin only)</li>

        </ul>
        <li>On the Dashboard Page, the user can see general information about how many matches are today and in the
          future and place a bet
          if he want, he can see how much money he has. <br> All of the matches have two rats. Each user can place a bet
          consisting
          of one or multiple matches (on the same ticket). The elevation is calculated by adding each elevation the user
          pressed on.
          The possible profit is calculated by multiplying the amount of money the user wants to bet with the total
          elevation. If the user places
          his bet, it will apear on the Your Bets page and the winner will be chosen at random after the match is over
          (15 minutes after starting time). </li>
        <li>On the Past Matches Page, the user can choose a date and have all the matches from that day, with their
          outcomes, displayed.</li>
        <li>On the User Profile Settings Page, the user can change his personal information.</li>
        <li>On the Your Bets Page, the user can see his tickets and if he won or not. If a ticket was guessed correctly
          (i.e. all the matches on the ticket were guessed correctly), funds will be added automatically to the user's
          account when accessing this page.</li>
        <li>On the Add a match Page, the admin can add a match or delete it.</li>
        <li>On the Rat Profile Page, the user can see all information about one specific rat.</li>
        <li>On the Add money Page, the user can add money (valid credit card number is required as a regex is used)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2><span>4. </span>Technologies used</h2>
      <section id="htmlcssjs">
        <h3><span>4.1 </span>HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5: The standard markup language for displaying documents in a browser. It is the backbone of the
            front-end.</li>
          <li>CSS3: The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. Heavily
            used in styiling our website.</li>
          <li>JavaScript: Mainly used for placing bets. The user clicks the buttons which have the elevations written on
            them and, using JS, we can deactivate or reactivate buttons and modify the final sum according to the
            buttons we pressed.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="PHP">
        <h3><span>4.2 </span>PHP</h3>
        PHP is a general-purpose, server side scripting language, suited for web development, that can be embedded in
        HTML.
        It is used mainly for managing a database, to track sessions and to do verifications which wouldn't be possible
        without scripting in general.
        In our application it is used often to query the database to print on the screen certain things, like the
        current user's bets, all of today's matches or the current user's information.
        It is also used to check the user's role, to redirect users which are not logged in, or to generate reports
        (HTML/CSV/JSON).
      </section>
      <section id="mySQL">
        <h3><span>4.3 </span>MySQL</h3>
        MySQL is a very popular DBMS, which we use to manage our database and our tables. We have 5 tables in our
        database, used by PHP in queries.
        <li>Users: Keeps track of all the registered users (name, age, email and so on). </li>
        <li>Rat: Keeps information related to rats, like their performance, their name, their place of birth. </li>
        <li>Matches: Has information about the participants and the status of a match. </li>
        <li>Tickets: Keeps information about the bets placed by the users (like the profit or the rat they betted on).
        </li>
        <li>Matches_Tickets: The table which connects the Matches and the Tickets tables (as a ticket can have multiple
          matches betted on). </li>
      </section>
      <section id="ajax">
        <h3><span>4.4 </span>Ajax</h3>
        Ajax is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create
        asynchronous web applications.
        With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the
        display and behaviour of the existing page.
        We use Ajax for the past matches page, as we retrieve matches from a certain date without refreshing the page.
        (after the user chooses the date).
